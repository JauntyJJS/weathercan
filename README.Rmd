<!-- [![CRAN\_Status\_Badge](https://www.r-pkg.org/badges/version/weathercan)](https://cran.r-project.org/package=weathercan) [![CRAN Downloads](http://cranlogs.r-pkg.org/badges/grand-total/weathercan)](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=weathercan) -->


This package makes it easier to search for and download multiple months/years of historical weather data from [Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC) website](https://climate.weather.gc.ca/historical_data/search_historic_data_e.html).

Bear in mind that these downloads can be fairly large and performing multiple downloads may use up ECCC's bandwidth unnecessarily. Try to stick to what you need.

For more details and tutorials checkout the [weathercan website](https://docs.ropensci.org/weathercan/) (or see the [development docs](http://ropensci.github.io/weathercan/))

> Check out the Demo weathercan shiny dashboard ([html](https://steffilazerte.shinyapps.io/weathercan_shiny/); [source](https://github.com/steffilazerte/weathercan_shiny))

## Installation

You can install `weathercan` from the [rOpenSci r-Universe](https://ropensci.r-universe.dev/ui/):

```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("weathercan", 
                 repos = c("https://ropensci.r-universe.dev", 
                           "https://cloud.r-project.org"))
```

## General usage

To download data, you first need to know the `station_id` associated with the station you're interested in.

### Stations

`weathercan` includes the function `stations()` which returns a list of stations and their details (including `station_id`).

```{r}
head(stations())
glimpse(stations())
```

You can look through this data frame directly, or you can use the `stations_search` function:

```{r}
stations_search("Kamloops", interval = "hour")
```

Time frame must be one of "hour", "day", or "month".

You can also search by proximity:

```{r}
stations_search(coords = c(50.667492, -120.329049), dist = 20, interval = "hour")
```

You can update this list of stations with 

```{r}
stations_dl()
```

And check when it was last updated with
```{r}
stations_meta()
```

**Note:** For reproducibility, if you are using the stations list to gather your
data, it can be a good idea to take note of the ECCC date of modification and 
include it in your reports/manuscripts.

### Weather

Once you have your `station_id`(s) you can download weather data:

```{r, R.options = list(tibble.max_extra_cols = 0)}
kam <- weather_dl(station_ids = 51423, start = "2018-02-01", end = "2018-04-15")
kam
```

You can also download data from multiple stations at once:

```{r, R.options = list(tibble.max_extra_cols = 0)}
kam_pg <- weather_dl(station_ids = c(48248, 51423), start = "2018-02-01", end = "2018-04-15")
```

## Climate Normals

To access climate normals, you first need to know the `climate_id` associated with the station you're interested in.

```{r}
stations_search("Winnipeg", normals_years = "current")
```

Then you can download the climate normals with the `normals_dl()` function.

```{r}
n <- normals_dl("5023222")
```

## Similar packages

**[`rclimateca`](https://github.com/paleolimbot/rclimateca)**

`weathercan` and `rclimateca` were developed at roughly the same time and as a result, both present up-to-date methods for accessing and downloading data from ECCC. The largest differences between the two packages are: a) `weathercan` includes functions for interpolating weather data and directly integrating it into other data sources. b) `weathercan` actively seeks to apply tidy data principles in R and integrates well with the tidyverse including using tibbles and nested listcols. c) `rclimateca` contains arguments for specifying short vs. long data formats. d) `rclimateca` has the option of formatting data in the MUData format using the [`mudata2`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=mudata2) package by the same author.

**[`CHCN`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=CHCN)**

`CHCN` is an older package last updated in 2012. Unfortunately, ECCC updated their services within the last couple of years which caused a great many of the previous web scrapers to fail. `CHCN` relies on a decommissioned [older web-scraper](https://quickcode.io/) and so is currently broken.
